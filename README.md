>ABSTRACT:

This thesis provides a detailed description of the toric code model, which plays an important
role in the field of quantum computation as a paradigmatic example of quantum error
correction code. After a preliminary introductory section on spin observables in Quantum
Mechanics, the rst chapter of the thesis contains the description of the model of the toric
code Hamiltonian followed by the computation of its ground states and excited states,
which are classied in terms of their topological properties. In particular, we will show
that the excitations are represented by two species of quasi-particles obeying to mutual
fractional statisctics. After a brief overview of classical and quantum error correction,
the analysis of the anyonic excitations of the toric code done in the rst chapter is then
used to explicitly describe the strategy behind quantum error correction for logical qubits
encoded in the ground states of the toric code Hamiltonian.
