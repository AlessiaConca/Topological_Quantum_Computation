	%\caption{Worm string of adjacent edges. The head is represented with a rhombus, while the tail is represented with a circle. The worm body is highlighted in black as to indicate that it could be formed by ocuupied edges if and only if there was no previously occupied edge before. Otherwise it would have been flipped to unoccupied.}
