\section{Excited states}
\label{sec:ES}

%We shall now examine the case of a square lattice with boundary conditions, i.e. the toric code. \newline

Taking into account the results yielded by the examination of the physical system in the previous chapters we will now proceed to describe, firstly, what are the excitations on the ground state and what kind of excitations we can obtain on the ground state; after this, we will examine the exchange statistics of the excitations.\newline
In general, the low-energy excitations of a quantum system, often referred to as quasiparticles, represent deviations from the system's ground state. These excitations are associated with elementary quantum particles that can be created or annihilated with relatively low energy. The properties of these quasiparticles, including their statistics, are crucial for gaining insights into the system's ground state degeneracy, topological properties, and response to external perturbations. \newline

In the particular case of the Toric Code, such low-energy excitations can be created in two ways: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item through the application of an open-ended string $S^x$ made up of $\sigma^x$ operators on the ground state;
	
	\item through the application of an open-ended string $S^z$ made up of $\sigma^z$ operators on the ground state.
\end{enumerate}

At the extremities of the above mentioned strings, particles are created. We will call the pairs of particles obtained through the application of operator $S^x$ \textit{electric charges}, while the ones obatained by applying an $S^z$ operator to the ground states \textit{magnetic vortices}.\newline

\newpage
We can prove that if a string $S^x$ of $\sigma^x$ operators is open-ended, then the $\sigma^x$ operators at its two extremes of the string will anticommute with one $A_v$ each. \newline 

\textit{Proof.}\newline
We want to show that $A_v S^x + S^x A_v=0$.\newline

Knowing that 

\begin{center}
	$A_v = \prod_{i=1}^{4} \sigma_i^z$ \\ 
	$S^x = \prod_{j=1}^{N} \sigma_j^x$
\end{center}

by substitution we obtain the following expression: \newline

\begin{center}
	$\prod_{i=1}^{4} \prod_{j=1}^{N} \sigma_j^x + \prod_{j=1}^{N} \sigma_j^x \prod_{i=1}^{4} \sigma_i^z = 0$ $(1)$
\end{center}

remeber that only one $\sigma_i^z$ will overlap with the extremity of the string $S^x$; thus, only one $\sigma_i^z$ will anticommute with the extremity of the string $S^x$. Knowing that for Pauli matrices acting on the same edge we have anticommutation

\begin{center}
	$\sigma_{v'}^x \sigma_{v'}^z = - \sigma_{v'}^z \sigma_v^x$ for $v=v'$ \\
	$\sigma_v^x \sigma_{v'}^z =  \sigma_{v'}^z \sigma_v^x$ for $v \neq v'$ 
\end{center}

if for simplicity we fix $N=2$ we can easily see that :\newline

\begin{center}
	$(\sigma_1^z \sigma_2^z \sigma_3^z \sigma_4^z)(\sigma_1^x \sigma_2^x)  = - (\sigma_1^x \sigma_2^x)(\sigma_1^z \sigma_2^z \sigma_3^z \sigma_4^z) $ 
\end{center}

having supposed that, for example, the extremity $\sigma_1^x$ overlaps with the $\sigma_3^z$ edge part of the $A_v$ operator. This can then be easily generalized for $N$ Pauli operators. Finally, if we substitute such expressione in $(1)$ we obtain that the overall equation is in fact equal to zero.\newline

This procedure should be iterated also for the other extremity of the string $S^x$ to show that the operator commutes with two $A_v$ operators, one for each endpoint.\newline

\hfill $\square$ \newline

In the same way, we could prove that, if we take a string $S^z$ made up of $\sigma_z$ operators still open-ended, the $\sigma^z$ operators at its endpoints will anticommute with one $B_p$ each.\newline


The effect of putting such strings on the ground states correspond to raising the associated energy of the GS by 2. In fact, coherently with what said in \textit{\cite{Her20}}, it is impossible to create unitary excitations on the ground states.

\begin{proposition}(Magnitude of the excitations)
	Placing string operators on the ground states correspond to raising the associated energy of the GS by 2.
\end{proposition}

\textit{Proof.} \newline
Recall that for a string operator, here we will choose $S^x$, both equations hold:

\begin{center}
	$\begin{cases} 
		A_{v1} S^x + S^x A_{v1} =0 \\
		A_{v2} S^x + S^x A_{v2} =0
	\end{cases}$ 
\end{center}

If we apply the string operator to the Ground State, taking into account anticommutativity stated above, we obtain that:

\begin{center}
	$\begin{cases}
		A_{v1} S^x |GS\rangle = - S^x A_{v1} |GS\rangle = - S^x |GS\rangle \\
		
		A_{v2} S^x |GS\rangle = - S^x A_{v2} |GS\rangle = - S^x |GS\rangle
	\end{cases}$ 
\end{center}

since $A_{v1}|GS\rangle = +1|GS\rangle$ and $A_{v2}|GS\rangle = +1|GS\rangle$.
Summing up term by term :

\begin{center}
	$\begin{cases}
		A_{v1} S^x |GS\rangle + A_{v2} S^x |GS\rangle = - 2 S^x A_{v1} |GS\rangle
	\end{cases}$ 
\end{center}

Thus, if the energy of the Ground State as we have defined it in the previous chapters is $-2N$ by acting with a string operator on  it we obtain a final energy equal to $-2N+2$.

\hfill $\square$ \newline

%Firstly, we study the individual statistics of electric charges and magnetic votices, then we argue their mutual statistics.\newline

Let's analyze the statistics of $e$-particles in the context of the ground state, \textit{as exemplified in \cite{Rao16}}. If we take a simple string operator $\sigma^z|GS\rangle$ , where $|GS\rangle$ denotes the ground state, it creates two $e$-particles in the vertices adjacent to the edge as shown in figure 1.11. \newline 
We know that a string operator of the form $\prod_{j=1}^{N} \sigma_j^z$ allows the separation of these two excitations. In fact, as illustrated below, the exchange of these particles becomes possible by applying the string operator in such a way that it moves the excitations around the lattice until they reach configuration shown in figure 1.11(c). 
However, due to the commutation of all $\sigma^x$ with each other, after the application of a closed loop of $\sigma^x$ (last passage in figure 1.11), there is no overall acquired phase. Consequently, the $e$-excitations exhibit bosonic statistics. A similar argument can be made for the $m$-excitations, establishing them as bosons as well.\newline

\section{Anyonic excitations}
\label{sec:AE}

Let's examine the mutual statistics between e and m particles. Initially, we generate pairs of e and m excitations at distinct chosen sites by applying the operator $\sigma^z\sigma^x|GS\rangle$. Afterward, we separate the excitations using string operators and we move an m-particle around an e-particle, as depicted below. Notably, there is a site where $\sigma^z$ must pass beyond a $\sigma^x$ spin, resulting in an anticommutation and thus introducing a minus sign. The closed loop can be eliminated, leading to the following transformation:

\begin{center}
	$\sigma_i^z\sigma_j^x|GS\rangle = - \sigma_i^x\sigma^z|GS\rangle$
\end{center}

if we denote the exchange operator as $R$ then the wave function relation should be the following:

\begin{center}
	$R^2\psi(e,m) = - \psi(e,m)$
\end{center}

since we are going all the way around the particle, we assume to have two exchanges. Then we simply find out that:

\begin{center}
	$R^2 = - 1 \rightarrow ( e^{-\frac{i\pi}{2}})^2 = - 1  \rightarrow R = e^{-\frac{i\pi}{2}} = \pm i $
\end{center}

this results falls out of the usual bosonic/fermionic statistics, thus we can say that the low-energy excitations of the ground state exhibit anyonic statistics.\newline


%riguardare

In a formal mathematical context, it can be articulated that the examination presented in the initial section categorizes particles within the realm of the permutation group $\mathbb{P}_N$. Conversely, the subsequent analysis in paragraph two places particles under the classification of the braid group $\mathbb{B}_N$. \newline

The permutation group $\mathbb{P}_N$ is defined as the collective set of all conceivable permutations involving $N$ objects. Within this group, the operation of group multiplication (exchange) corresponds to the sequential application of permutations, and the group inverse involves the reversal of the permutation.
Here, executing a permutation twice on two objects results in the restoration of the system to its initial configuration. Consequently, particles exhibiting transformations in accordance with representations of the permutation group can exclusively fall into the categories of either bosons or fermions. \newline

On the other hand, when it comes to objects that are part of the braid group $\mathbb{B}_N$, we can visualise the process of moving (or exchanging) particles as paths in spacetime with time being the vertical axis and space being the horizontal axis. The particles can circle around each other and form closed paths by coming back to their original positions. \newline

In a formal sense, we define the braid group $\mathbb{B}_N$ as the collection of diverse trajectories that arise during the adiabatic transport of $N$ particles. These trajectories depict the evolution of a configuration of $N$ particles from a specific time, denoted as 0, to another time, denoted as $t$. It is essential that the world lines of the particles neither intersect nor create entangled structures or loops. Maintaining a consistent count of $N$ particles at each moment is crucial. Consequently, every set of trajectories followed by the $N$ particles can be characterized as a braid. \newline
